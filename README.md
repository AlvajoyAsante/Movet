# Movét 🕺💻  
A web-based platform using Pose AI to transform screen time into active, engaging fun.

## 🚀 About the Project
Movét was developed during Hack with CAIR 2025 to explore how AI can be used for good—specifically to combat rising physical inactivity among both young and elderly populations. By using pose estimation and computer vision, we created interactive games that promote movement and health without the need for VR gear—just a camera.
